In this code, we include the required libraries for Blynk, CCS811 sensor, and the ESP8266 WiFi module.

Replace 'YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN' with the authentication token obtained from the Blynk project. Also, replace 'YOUR_WIFI_SSID' and 'YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD' with your Wi-Fi network credentials.

The setup() function initializes the serial communication, connects to the Wi-Fi network, and initializes the CCS811 sensor.

The loop() function reads the air quality data from the sensor using the ccs.geteCO2() and ccs.getTVOC() functions. It then sends this data to the Blynk app using Blynk.virtualWrite() for the AQI and CO2 virtual pins. The data is also printed to the serial monitor for debugging purposes.

Ensure that you have selected the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE before uploading the code to the NodeMCU board.

After uploading the code, you can open the Blynk app and monitor the air quality index (AQI) and equivalent CO2 level on the Value Display and Gauge widgets respectively.
